This repository explains how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Google Colab with free GPU!

**note**: It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.5, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow.

My Colab notebook describes every step required to get going with your own object detection classifier.
I'm used to train my own **electricity meter detector**, BUT acually, you can retrain it on your own dataset and get your own detector. just follow my instructions on colab notebook and will be able by end of it to have your very own custom object detection that will be able to detect all sorts of object..whatever you choose whatever you imagine you'll be able to do it !

**Enjoy**
